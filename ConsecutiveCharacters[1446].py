# The power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

# Given a string s, return the power of s.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leetcode"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 500
# s consists of only lowercase English letters.
