# 2278. Percentage of Letter in String
# Easy

# Given a string s and a character letter, return the percentage of characters in s that equal letter rounded down to the nearest whole percent.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "foobar", letter = "o"
# Output: 33
# Explanation:
# The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'o' is 2 / 6 * 100% = 33% when rounded down, so we return 33.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "jjjj", letter = "k"
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'k' is 0%, so we return 0.

 

# Constraints:

#     1 <= s.length <= 100
#     s consists of lowercase English letters.
#     letter is a lowercase English letter.
