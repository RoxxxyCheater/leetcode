# 2652. Sum Multiples
# Easy

# Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.

# Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 7
# Output: 21
# Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.

# Example 2:

# Input: n = 10
# Output: 40
# Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. The sum of these numbers is 40.

# Example 3:

# Input: n = 9
# Output: 30
# Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 9] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9. The sum of these numbers is 30.
