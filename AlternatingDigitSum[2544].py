# You are given a positive integer n. Each digit of n has a sign according to the following rules:

# The most significant digit is assigned a positive sign.
# Each other digit has an opposite sign to its adjacent digits.
# Return the sum of all digits with their corresponding sign.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 521
# Output: 4
# Explanation: (+5) + (-2) + (+1) = 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 111
# Output: 1
# Explanation: (+1) + (-1) + (+1) = 1.
# Example 3:

# Input: n = 886996
# Output: 0
# Explanation: (+8) + (-8) + (+6) + (-9) + (+9) + (-6) = 0.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= n <= 109
