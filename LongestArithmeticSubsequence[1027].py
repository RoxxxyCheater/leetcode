# 1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence
# Medium

# Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.

# Note that:

#     A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
#     A sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [3,6,9,12]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:  The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [9,4,7,2,10]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:  The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].

# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:  The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].

 

# Constraints:

#     2 <= nums.length <= 1000
#     0 <= nums[i] <= 500
