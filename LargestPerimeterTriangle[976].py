# 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle
# Easy

# Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,1,2]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: 
# You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
# You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
# You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
# As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.

 

# Constraints:

#     3 <= nums.length <= 104
#     1 <= nums[i] <= 106
