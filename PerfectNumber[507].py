# A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. A divisor of an integer x is an integer that can divide x evenly.

# Given an integer n, return true if n is a perfect number, otherwise return false.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: num = 28
# Output: true
# Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
# 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 are all divisors of 28.
# Example 2:

# Input: num = 7
# Output: false
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= num <= 108
