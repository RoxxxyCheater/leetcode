# 1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three
# Medium

# Given an integer n, return true if it is possible to represent n as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return false.

# An integer y is a power of three if there exists an integer x such that y == 3x.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 12
# Output: true
# Explanation: 12 = 31 + 32

# Example 2:

# Input: n = 91
# Output: true
# Explanation: 91 = 30 + 32 + 34

# Example 3:

# Input: n = 21
# Output: false

 

# Constraints:

#     1 <= n <= 107
