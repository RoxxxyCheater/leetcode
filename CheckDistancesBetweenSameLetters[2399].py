# You are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase English letters, where each letter in s appears exactly twice. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array distance of length 26.

# Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from 0 to 25 (i.e. 'a' -> 0, 'b' -> 1, 'c' -> 2, ... , 'z' -> 25).

# In a well-spaced string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the ith letter is distance[i]. If the ith letter does not appear in s, then distance[i] can be ignored.

# Return true if s is a well-spaced string, otherwise return false.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abaccb", distance = [1,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# - 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance[0] = 1.
# - 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance[1] = 3.
# - 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance[2] = 0.
# Note that distance[3] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.
# Return true because s is a well-spaced string.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "aa", distance = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
# Output: false
# Explanation:
# - 'a' appears at indices 0 and 1 so there are zero letters between them.
# Because distance[0] = 1, s is not a well-spaced string.
 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= s.length <= 52
# s consists only of lowercase English letters.
# Each letter appears in s exactly twice.
# distance.length == 26
# 0 <= distance[i] <= 50
