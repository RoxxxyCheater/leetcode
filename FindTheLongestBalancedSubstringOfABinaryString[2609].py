# You are given a binary string s consisting only of zeroes and ones.

# A substring of s is considered balanced if all zeroes are before ones and the number of zeroes is equal to the number of ones inside the substring. Notice that the empty substring is considered a balanced substring.

# Return the length of the longest balanced substring of s.

# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "01000111"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "000111", which has length 6.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "00111"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "0011", which has length 4. 
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "111"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There is no balanced substring except the empty substring, so the answer is 0.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 50
# '0' <= s[i] <= '1'
