# You are given a positive integer array nums.

# The element sum is the sum of all the elements in nums.
# The digit sum is the sum of all the digits (not necessarily distinct) that appear in nums.
# Return the absolute difference between the element sum and digit sum of nums.

# Note that the absolute difference between two integers x and y is defined as |x - y|.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,15,6,3]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: 
# The element sum of nums is 1 + 15 + 6 + 3 = 25.
# The digit sum of nums is 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 3 = 16.
# The absolute difference between the element sum and digit sum is |25 - 16| = 9.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# The element sum of nums is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
# The digit sum of nums is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
# The absolute difference between the element sum and digit sum is |10 - 10| = 0.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 2000
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 2000
