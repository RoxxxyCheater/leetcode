# You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

# Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
# Output: false
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
# flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
# There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
# 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length
