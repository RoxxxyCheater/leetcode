# 169. Majority Element
# Easy

# Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

# The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [3,2,3]
# Output: 3

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
# Output: 2

 

# Constraints:

#     n == nums.length
#     1 <= n <= 5 * 104
#     -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

 
# Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
