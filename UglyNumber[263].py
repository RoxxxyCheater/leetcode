# An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

# Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 6
# Output: true
# Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
# Example 3:

# Input: n = 14
# Output: false
# Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 

# Constraints:

# -231 <= n <= 231 - 1
